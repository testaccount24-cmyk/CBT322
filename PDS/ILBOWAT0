Hi Sam

I found a neat trick with cobol that you probably already know
about.  Have you ever heard of the ILBOWAT0 command in old school
cobol?  It allows you to pause the execution of a program for a
set number of seconds.  It fortunately still works in cobol for
mvs and such but is no longer documented.  The neat thing is that
I can use it in rexx, by calling a cobol program with the
command, and allow my rexx program to pause for 1 second
intervals.  In my new shop, they don't grant authorization to
Open MVS Linux commands which shut me out of using the sleep
function that I need in Jumplist.
